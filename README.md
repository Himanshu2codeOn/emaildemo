Complete demo code for the article on sending email with images for SmartBear

We have all received email that contains images, and now you'd like to send an email just like that from your Java code.  We will look at the basics of using JavaMail, sending HTML messages, and using MIME to create a multipart message that encloses the image or images you want to include.  This will show the image in the body of the message.  You can also use this technique to attach images or documents of other types to the message, so that they can be saved separately.
